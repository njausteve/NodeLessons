# NodeLessons


As Wikipedia states: “Node.js is a packaged compilation of Google’s V8 JavaScript engine, the libuv platform abstraction layer,
and a core library, which is itself primarily written in JavaScript.”
Beyond that, it’s worth noting that Ryan Dahl, the creator 
of Node.js, was aiming to create real-time websites with push capability, “inspired
by applications like Gmail”. 
In Node.js, he gave developers a tool for working in the non-blocking, event-driven I/O paradigm.
